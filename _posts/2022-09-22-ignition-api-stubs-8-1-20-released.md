After several _beta_ releases we, at the ignition-api organization, have determined that the `ignition-api-stubs` package has reached certain stability and it will be out of beta.

If you happen to run into any issues, or have a feature request, please submit it at the [`ignition-api/8.1`](https://github.com/ignition-api/8.1) repo.

Thanks for reading.
