We are proud to announce three new formulae!

- [ignition](https://formulae.coatl.dev/formula/ignition) (More info [here]({{ site.url }}/news/2021/03/04/stay-up-to-date-with-the-ignition-formula))
- [ignition-edge@8.1.4](https://formulae.coatl.dev/formula/ignition-edge@8.1.4)
- [ignition@8.1.4](https://formulae.coatl.dev/formula/ignition@8.1.4)

## How do I install these formulae?

To install these formulae, first tap our Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew tap coatl-dev/coatl-dev
```

And then, for `ignition-edge@8.1.4`:

```bash
brew install ignition-edge@8.1.4
```

Or for `ignition@8.1.4`:

```bash
brew install ignition@8.1.4
```

Or for `ignition`:

```bash
brew install ignition
```

Or with one single command.

For `ignition-edge@8.1.4`:

```bash
brew install coatl-dev/coatl-dev/ignition-edge@8.1.4
```

Or for `ignition@8.1.4`:

```bash
brew install coatl-dev/coatl-dev/ignition@8.1.4
```

Or for `ignition`:

```bash
brew install coatl-dev/coatl-dev/ignition
```

## How do I upgrade the `ignition` formula?

First, stop the `ignition` service by running the following commands:

```bash
$ brew services stop ignition
Stopping `ignition`... (might take a while)
==> Successfully stopped `ignition` (label: homebrew.mxcl.ignition)
$ ignition stop
Stopping Ignition-Gateway...
Stopped Ignition-Gateway.
```

Then, if you pinned the previous version, unpin it by running:

```bash
brew unpin ignition
```

Finally run `brew update` and `brew upgrade`:

```bash
$ brew update
==> New Formulae
coatl-dev/coatl-dev/ignition-edge@8.1.4                      coatl-dev/coatl-dev/ignition@8.1.4
==> Updated Formulae
coatl-dev/coatl-dev/ignition ‚úî

You have 1 outdated formula installed.
You can update it with brew upgrade.

## How do I start the Ignition Gateway?

{: .box-warning}
Warning: Please make sure you don't have another Ignition Gateway running on port `8088`. If you do, please stop it by running `ignition@X.X.X stop`, `ignition-edge@X.X.X stop` or `ignition stop`.

Once installed, open a new Terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
ignition-edge@8.1.4 start
```

Or

```bash
ignition@8.1.4 start
```

Or

```bash
ignition start
```

Once the Service starts, you can go to <http://localhost:8088/> to provision your Gateway.

## How do I start Ignition automatically at login?

Run the following command:

```bash
brew services start coatl-dev/coatl-dev/ignition-edge@8.1.4
```

Or

```bash
brew services start coatl-dev/coatl-dev/ignition@8.1.4
